    <h2>Personal Insurance</h2>
    <div class="journal">
      <h5>Relax knowing that you're protected!</h5>
      <aside style="padding: 1em;">
        <i>Umbrella coverage for auto, home, renters, fire and more.</i>
      </aside>
      <p>
        As we all know, life can be unpredictable. Having a lifeline to protect you and your
        family from the unexpected is a must in today's society. Would you be covered if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the family pet injures a neighbor?</li>
        <li>a tree on your property falls into a nearby house?</li>
        <li>a child is hurt while visiting your house?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While you have homeowners insurance, it will not always be sufficient to cover such
        unforeseeable events. Umbrella coverage policies provide that extended protection needed
        to go above and beyond your basic home or auto insurance policy in case you run into an
        unexpected situation.
